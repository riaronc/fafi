# Authentication Flow

The app implements email and password authentication with a secure flow.

## Authentication Process

### User Registration
1. User navigates to `/auth/register`
2. User fills in email, password, and name
3. System validates the form (email format, password strength)
4. System checks if email is already registered
5. If validation passes, the system:
   - Creates a new user record with hashed password
   - Sends a verification email (optional)
   - Redirects to login page with success message

### User Login
1. User navigates to `/auth/login`
2. User enters email and password
3. System validates credentials against database
4. If valid:
   - Creates a session
   - Sets authentication cookies
   - Redirects to dashboard
5. If invalid:
   - Shows error message
   - Allows retry

### Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends password reset link to email
4. User clicks link in email
5. User sets new password
6. System updates password hash in database
7. User is redirected to login

### Session Management
- Sessions expire after inactivity period
- "Remember me" feature extends session duration
- Multiple devices supported

### Logout
1. User clicks logout button
2. System invalidates the session
3. User is redirected to login page

## Authentication Implementation

### Client-Side Auth Components
- `AuthProvider` context for global auth state
- `useAuth` hook for accessing auth functionality
- Protected route wrappers

### Server-Side Auth
- Authentication middleware for API routes
- Session validation on server-side rendering
- CSRF protection for forms

### Database Schema for Auth
- User table with hashed passwords
- Session table for active sessions
- Password reset tokens table

## Security Measures
- Passwords stored using bcrypt
- HTTPS for all connections
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities:
  - SQL injection
  - XSS attacks
  - CSRF attacks
